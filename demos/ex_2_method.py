# Exercise 2: Methods

# In this exercise, we will create your first method.
# A method (sometimes called a function, or subroutine) is a group of 
# statements we put together under a method name.
# We can use this method name to execute all the statements
# contained in this method.  An example is below:

# Declares a new method called 'my_method'.  Method definitions are declared
# using the 'def' keyword.
def my_method():
    # this is a list of statements.  Here we have only one for an example
	print("We are printing from my_method!")

# call the method we have created
print("This is the first statement, after this we will call my_method.")
my_method()


# Exercise:

# Remember, for every exercise you do, create a new branch to work from.

# 1.) Create a method with two print statements in it.  Call the method "display_info".

# 2.) Call the method twice.
